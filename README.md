## Moe Points and Clothing

MP = Moe Points

All powers are powered by MP.
Powers are granted by the equipment.
+ Stat and passive abilities are conferred via clothing and accessories.
+ Magic and active abilities are conferred via panties.
+ Each class wears different panties.
        
MP is exhausted through ability use.  The clothing gets dirty through use and must be washed to replenish MP.  Eventually clothing gets worn out and must be replaced.  Body spray can be used to temporarily replenish MP in battle.
    
Clothing can also be changed during battle to exchange effects.  But changing clothing takes time and makes the character vulnerable.  They can do it quickly at the risk of destroying the article of clothing.
